Title: By the Jade River

Chapter 1
 By a bare mountain, where the Jade River runs through, lies a poor, mud-covered village known as Mirkwood.
Within the village in a hole in the ground lived a boy by the name of Trev. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled 
with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, this was a hobbit hole and that means comfort.

Chapter 2
It was a hot summer day and Trev decided to go for a walk. He walked for miles and ran into Bisma, the Queen
of Mirkwood.  

Chapter 3 
The END.
