By a bare mountain, where the Jade River runs through, lies a poor, mud-covered village known as Mirkwood. Within the village in a hole in the ground lived a boy by the name of Trev. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, This was a hobbit hole and that means comfirt.
