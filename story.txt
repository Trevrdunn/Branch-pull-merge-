Title: By the Jade River

Chapter 1
 By a bare mountain, where the Jade River runs through, lies a poor, mud-covered village known as Mirkwood.
Within the village in a hole in the ground lived a boy by the name of Trev. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled 
with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, this was a hobbit hole and that means comfort.

Chapter 2
It was a hot summer day and Trev decided to go for a walk. He walked for miles and ran into Bisma, the Queen
of Mirkwood. Bisma looked at Trev and decided that he would be a good candidate for the wrestling competition
in Mirkwood. She asked him to come to the town center in two days. 

Chapter 3 
Mirkwood, despite its name.... was a beautiful land with rolling hills and blue winged pixies that spread dolled out happiness with pixie dust. 
The day of the match Trev was scared yet full of energy. As he entered the ring everyone cheered with power. as the crowed simmered and the lights got dark Phil the ring master anounced his opponent. "In the left corner we have the great and might defending champion Yosan". 
The crowed screams in excitment. 

Chapter 4
The END.
